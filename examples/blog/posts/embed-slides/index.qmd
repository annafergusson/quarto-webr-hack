This is a post that contains slides with interactive code on a [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) through the [`quarto-webr`](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr) extension. The configuration setup for the `quarto-webr` extension is taken care of in the `_quarto.yml` file to avoid needing to re-specify options multiple times.

## Presentation

:::{.callout-important}
For `quarto-webr` to work within RevealJS, you must use a [**pre-release** version of Quarto that is 1.4.502 or greater](https://quarto.org/docs/download/prerelease) that contains an updated copy of `pandoc`. For more details, please see [Issue #14](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/14).
